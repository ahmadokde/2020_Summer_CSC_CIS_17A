 * Purpose: Movie Data Structure
 *      Step by step Solution
 *      0 - Copy the Template
 * Why?  Cause many of you put absolute crap all over the place.
 * You just start plugging in garbage, no comments, no organization.  No
 * methodical approach to how you are going to solve the problem.  This
 * is especially true when you are trying to use a new concept.  So, at
 * least if you start from a template that is trying to tell you where to
 * put things, then there might be some initial organization.  Of course, 
 * you would have to read/look at those comments.

//User Level Libraries/Includes here.  On Code-E we have to put
//structures and classes here before main but you would never do this
//for normal projects.  We would just include many .h files

//Global Constants Only - Science/Math Related, Conversions, Higher
//Dimensions.  Put Global Variables anywhere in your program i.e. variables
//not contained in functions and I will give you an F!  Local variables
//only allowed.

//Function Prototypes here, Function implementations after main!

//Execution Begins Here!

    //Random Number Seed Set Here.  No-where else.  Only done once!
    //Putting it here make sure it is only done once.
