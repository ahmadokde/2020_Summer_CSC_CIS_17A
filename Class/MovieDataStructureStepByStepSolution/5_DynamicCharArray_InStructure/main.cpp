 * Purpose: Movie Data Structure
 *      Step by step Solution
 *      0 - Copy the Template
 *      1 - Read in 1 Set of Data and Verify
 *      2 - Read in N Sets of Data and Verify
 *      3 - Format the Results
 *      4 - Static Structure Array
 *      5 - Change to a Dynamic Char Array inside Static Structure
 * Why? You should be able to handle character arrays and size them 
 * as needed.  Make sure you allocate and deallocate the arrays before
 * you exit or there will be a memory leak.

//System Level Libraries
#include <iostream>   //I/O Library
#include <cstdlib>    //Random Number Generator, Setting seed, etc....
#include <iomanip>    //Formatting Library
using namespace std;  //Libraries compiled under std

//User Level Libraries/Includes here.  On Code-E we have to put
//structures and classes here before main but you would never do this
//for normal projects.  We would just include many .h files

//Note:  The ADT should start with a capital letter and be as close to
//7 characters in length.  
struct MovieInfo{
    string movName;//Strings are good
    char *dirName;//You should know how to deal with dynamic character arrays
    unsigned short yrRlsd; //Don't need a larger data size and always > 0
    unsigned short runTime;//Don't need a larger data size and always > 0
};

//Global Constants Only - Science/Math Related, Conversions, Array and Higher
//Dimensions.  Put Global Variables anywhere in your program i.e. variables
//not contained in functions and I will give you an F!  Local variables
//only allowed.

//Function Prototypes here, Function implementations after main!

//Execution Begins Here!

    //Then I just formatted.
