 * Purpose: Movie Data Structure
 *      Step by step Solution
 *      0 - Copy the Template
 *      1 - Read in 1 Set of Data and Verify
 *      2 - Read in N Sets of Data and Verify
 *      3 - Format the Results
 *      4 - Static Structure Array
 *      5 - Change to a Dynamic Char Array inside Static Structure
 *      6 - Dynamic Structure
 *      7 - Fill Structure Function
 *      8 - Display Function for the Structure
 *      9 - Deallocate Memory in a Function
 * Why? Make everything an ADT with functions!  This is how we code!!!

//System Level Libraries
#include <iostream>   //I/O Library
#include <cstdlib>    //Random Number Generator, Setting seed, etc....
#include <iomanip>    //Formatting Library
using namespace std;  //Libraries compiled under std

//User Level Libraries/Includes here.  On Code-E we have to put
//structures and classes here before main but you would never do this
//for normal projects.  We would just include many .h files

//Note:  The ADT should start with a capital letter and be as close to
//7 characters in length.  
struct MovieInfo{
    string movName;//Strings are good
    char *dirName;//You should know how to deal with dynamic character arrays
    unsigned short yrRlsd; //Don't need a larger data size and always > 0
    unsigned short runTime;//Don't need a larger data size and always > 0
};

//Global Constants Only - Science/Math Related, Conversions, Array and Higher
//Dimensions.  Put Global Variables anywhere in your program i.e. variables
//not contained in functions and I will give you an F!  Local variables
//only allowed.

//Function Prototypes here, Function implementations after main!
MovieInfo *fillDat(int &);//Fill the Structure with Data
void display(MovieInfo *,int);//Display the info in the Structure Array
void destroy(MovieInfo *,int);//Deallocate Memory

//Execution Begins Here!
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    //Variable Declarations
    MovieInfo *mveInfo;//Pointer to the dynamic Movie structure.
    int nMovies;//How many movies?
    
    //Initialize the Data Structure
    mveInfo=fillDat(nMovies);
    
    //Now you can loop on the data as many times as it takes!
    display(mveInfo,nMovies);
    
    //Clean Up the Dynamic Stuff
    destroy(mveInfo,nMovies);

    //Exit stage right!
    return 0;
}

//Again, Just copy, cut, and paste into a function. Code already 
//checked out in main.
void destroy(MovieInfo *mveInfo,int nMovies){
    //Clean Up the Dynamic Stuff
    for(int mvees=0;mvees<nMovies;mvees++){
        delete [] mveInfo[mvees].dirName;//The character arrays in the Stucture
    }
    delete [] mveInfo;//Now the array of Structures
}

//Just copy, cut, and paste into a function.  Code already checked out in main.
void display(MovieInfo *mveInfo, int nMovies){
    //Now you can loop on the data as many times as it takes!
    for(int mvees=0;mvees<nMovies;mvees++){//Gotta frickin indent!!!!!
        //I copied the output from Code-E then applied formatting
        cout<<left<<endl;
        cout<<setw(11)<<"Title:"<<mveInfo[mvees].movName<<endl;
        cout<<setw(11)<<"Director:"<<mveInfo[mvees].dirName<<endl;
        cout<<setw(11)<<"Year:"<<mveInfo[mvees].yrRlsd<<endl;
        cout<<setw(11)<<"Length:"<<mveInfo[mvees].runTime<<endl;

//This implementation of this function was thoroughly tested out already
//in main.

    //Then I just formatted.

          "Released, and the Running Time in (minutes)."<<endl;
